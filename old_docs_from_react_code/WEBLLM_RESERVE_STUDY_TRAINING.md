# WebLLM Reserve Study Training Strategy

## Overview
This document outlines our comprehensive approach to training and orienting the WebLLM engine specifically for reserve study and property condition assessment expertise.

## Current Implementation Status âœ…

### 1. Prompt Engineering (Implemented)
- **Domain-Specific System Prompts**: All prompts now include reserve study expertise context
- **Industry Standards Integration**: ASTM E2018, IICRC, NFPA, and local building codes
- **Regulatory Framework Awareness**: Compliance requirements and deadlines
- **Financial Planning Context**: Reserve fund implications and capital planning

### 2. Knowledge Base Integration (Implemented)
```typescript
const RESERVE_STUDY_KNOWLEDGE = {
  componentTypes: ['HVAC Systems', 'Electrical Systems', 'Plumbing Systems', ...],
  conditionStates: ['Excellent', 'Good', 'Fair', 'Poor', 'Replace'],
  maintenanceTypes: ['Preventive', 'Corrective', 'Predictive', ...],
  regulatoryFrameworks: ['ASTM E2018', 'IICRC Standards', 'NFPA Codes', ...],
  riskFactors: ['Component Age', 'Usage Intensity', 'Environmental Exposure', ...]
};
```

## Advanced Training Strategies (Future Implementation)

### Strategy 1: Fine-Tuning with Domain Data
**Timeline**: Phase 4-5 (Post-MVP)
**Approach**:
- Collect anonymized reserve study reports and inspection data
- Fine-tune Llama model on reserve study specific language patterns
- Train on component lifecycle data and deterioration curves
- Incorporate regulatory compliance patterns

**Benefits**:
- Native understanding of reserve study terminology
- Accurate component lifecycle predictions
- Regulatory compliance awareness built into the model

### Strategy 2: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
**Timeline**: Phase 3-4
**Approach**:
- Create vector database of reserve study knowledge
- Include ASTM standards, regulatory documents, industry best practices
- Component specification databases and lifecycle tables
- Historical case studies and failure analysis reports

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// RAG-enhanced prompt structure
const ragPrompt = `
RESERVE STUDY KNOWLEDGE BASE:
${retrieveRelevantDocuments(query)}

INDUSTRY STANDARDS:
${retrieveASTMStandards(componentType)}

HISTORICAL CASE STUDIES:
${retrieveSimilarCases(componentCondition)}

USER QUERY: ${userInput}
`;
```

### Strategy 3: Few-Shot Learning with Examples
**Current Status**: Partially Implemented
**Enhancement**:
- Include 10-20 example reserve study analysis cases in prompts
- Show before/after examples of accurate vs. generic predictions
- Demonstrate proper regulatory compliance reasoning
- Include financial impact calculations

### Strategy 4: Continuous Learning Pipeline
**Timeline**: Phase 5+
**Approach**:
- User feedback loop for prediction accuracy
- Model performance monitoring and A/B testing
- Gradual fine-tuning based on successful predictions
- Integration with external reserve study databases

## Current Training Effectiveness

### âœ… Strengths
