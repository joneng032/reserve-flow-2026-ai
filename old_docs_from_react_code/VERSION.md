```

#### Development Workflow
```bash
# Desktop development (current)
git checkout windows-on-device-development
git pull origin windows-on-device-development

# Feature branches
git checkout -b feature/desktop-{feature-name}

# Release preparation
git checkout -b release/desktop-v3.0.0
npm run build-electron-win
# Test and validate
git tag reserve-flow-desktop-3.0.0-win
git push origin reserve-flow-desktop-3.0.0-win
```

### Compatibility Matrix

| Desktop Version | API Version | Database Schema | Compatibility |
|-----------------|-------------|-----------------|---------------|

## Branch-Specific Versioning: windows-on-device-development

### Branch Version Mapping
The `windows-on-device-development` branch uses branch-specific versioning to track independent development while maintaining compatibility with the main branch versioning scheme.

#### Current Branch Version
```
reserve-flow-desktop-3.0.0-electron-alpha-windows-on-device-development
```

#### Version Components
- **reserve-flow-desktop**: Platform identifier for Electron desktop application
- **3.0.0**: Major version reflecting architectural pivot from PWA to Electron
- **electron-alpha**: Platform and stability indicator (alpha for development)
- **windows-on-device-development**: Branch identifier for tracking separate development

#### Branch Release Tagging
```bash
# Branch-specific development releases
git tag reserve-flow-desktop-3.0.0-electron-alpha-windows-on-device-development-001
git tag reserve-flow-desktop-3.0.0-electron-alpha-windows-on-device-development-002

# Production release (when merging to main)
git checkout main
git merge windows-on-device-development
git tag reserve-flow-desktop-3.0.0-win
git push origin reserve-flow-desktop-3.0.0-win
```

#### Package.json Version Mapping
| Component | Branch Version | Main Branch Version |
|-----------|----------------|-------------------|
| Main App (`package.json`) | `3.0.0-electron-alpha` | `3.0.0` |
| API Server (`api_v3.0.0/package.json`) | `3.0.0-electron-alpha` | `3.0.0` |
| Database Schema | `1.0.0` | `1.0.0` |

#### Development Workflow
```bash
# Branch development
git checkout windows-on-device-development
npm version prerelease --preid=windows-on-device-development-001
git tag reserve-flow-desktop-$(npm version --json | jq -r .version)

# Main branch release
git checkout main
git merge windows-on-device-development
npm version 3.0.0
git tag reserve-flow-desktop-3.0.0-win
```
