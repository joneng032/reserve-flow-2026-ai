Deprecated — Google AI Migration Plan

Date: 2025-10-29
Author: Automated plan (draft) — superseded

Note: This file documents an earlier plan to migrate AI features to Google Cloud APIs. The team has chosen a local-first prototype approach instead (on-device STT/LLM/TTS) and a new, versioned plan has been created: `docs/LOCAL_AI_MIGRATION_PLAN_v4.10.x.md`.

If you previously referenced this Google migration plan, please see the new local-first plan (`LOCAL_AI_MIGRATION_PLAN_v4.10.x.md`) which describes the selected stack (Vosk, whisper.cpp, llama.cpp, Silero/Coqui, native platform TTS), updated phases, and a concrete prototype roadmap.

Status: superseded — see `docs/LOCAL_AI_MIGRATION_PLAN_v4.10.x.md` for the active plan.
