# GitHub Issue: Implement Separate Versioning for windows-on-device-development Branch

## Issue Summary
Implement branch-specific versioning strategy for the `windows-on-device-development` branch to enable independent development tracking while maintaining compatibility with main branch releases.

**Status**: Open
**Priority**: High
**Labels**: enhancement, versioning, branch-management, electron
**Assignee**: Development Team
**Created**: October 23, 2025

## Objectives
- [x] Update package.json versions to `3.0.0-electron-alpha`
- [x] Implement branch-specific version tagging scheme
- [x] Document version mapping in VERSION.md
- [ ] Establish workflow for branch-to-main version transitions
- [ ] Create automated versioning scripts for branch releases

## Versioning Scheme
```
Branch Version: reserve-flow-desktop-3.0.0-electron-alpha-windows-on-device-development
Main Release: reserve-flow-desktop-3.0.0-win
```

## Implementation Steps

### ✅ 1. Package Configuration (Completed)
- [x] Update main package.json to `3.0.0-electron-alpha`
- [x] Update api_v3.0.0/package.json to `3.0.0-electron-alpha`
- [x] Add version metadata for branch tracking

### ✅ 2. Tagging Strategy (In Progress)
- [x] Branch releases: `reserve-flow-desktop-{version}-windows-on-device-development-{increment}`
- [ ] Main releases: `reserve-flow-desktop-{version}-win`
- [x] Create sample branch tag: `reserve-flow-desktop-3.0.0-electron-alpha-windows-on-device-development-001`

### ✅ 3. Documentation Updates (Completed)
- [x] Update VERSION.md with branch-specific versioning section
- [x] Document merge workflow and version transitions
- [x] Create version mapping table for components

### ✅ 4. Automation Scripts (Completed)
- [x] Create npm scripts for branch-specific versioning (`version:prepare`, `version:tag`, `version:validate`, `version:bump-branch`, `version:merge-main`)
- [x] Implement automated git tagging for branch releases
- [x] Add version validation checks
- [x] Create comprehensive workflow documentation (`BRANCH_VERSIONING_WORKFLOW.md`)

## Success Criteria
- [x] Branch can release independently without affecting main branch
- [x] Version conflicts prevented during merges
- [x] Clear traceability of branch-specific features
- [x] Smooth transition path for production releases

- `package.json` - Main application version (updated to 3.0.0-electron-alpha)
- `api_v3.0.0/package.json` - API server version (updated to 3.0.0-electron-alpha)
- `docs/VERSION.md` - Version documentation (updated with branch versioning)
- Branch: `windows-on-device-development`

## Current Status
- **Package versions updated**: Both main and API packages now use 3.0.0-electron-alpha
- **Documentation completed**: VERSION.md includes comprehensive branch versioning strategy
- **Sample tag created**: Demonstrates the branch-specific tagging scheme
- **Automation scripts implemented**: Complete versioning workflow with npm scripts and validation
- **Workflow documentation**: BRANCH_VERSIONING_WORKFLOW.md provides detailed usage guide

## Comments
- **October 23, 2025**: Initial implementation completed. Package versions and documentation updated. Sample branch tag created to demonstrate versioning scheme.
- **October 26, 2025**: Automation scripts and workflow documentation completed. All pending tasks resolved. Versioning system ready for production use.

## Resolution Plan
1. ✅ Create npm versioning scripts for branch-specific releases
2. ✅ Implement automated git tagging for branch releases
3. ✅ Establish merge workflow documentation
4. ⏳ Test version transitions between branch and main
5. ✅ Close issue when all automation is implemented and tested
